## Setup your Windows 11 Computer

Follow this guide to setup your personal Windows computer.

This guide assumes that you have admin access to your computer.

1. Download and install the latest [**NVIDIA GPU Driver**](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) for your GPU.
2. Download and install [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
    * Shehzan's preferred installation options (other than defaults):
        * Adjusting your Path environment: Select `Use Git and optional tools from Command Prompt`. This option allows you to use Git from both Git Bash and Command Prompt.
        * Configuring the line ending conversion: Select `Checkout as-is, commit as-is`. Shehzan uses this option because he also changes all his preferred editors to use Unix line endings. If you do not want to change your editors, select `Checkout as-is, coming Unix-style line endings`.
        * Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Base: `Use Windows' default console window`.
        * Configuring extra options: Select `Enable symbolic links` in addition to default options.
        * Configuring experimental options: Select `Enable experimental support for pseudo consoles`.
    * After installation, follow the [**First Time Git Setup**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) Guide if this is the first time you are using Git.
3. Install **Visual Studio 2022**. We recommend (but not require) that you wipe out any old versions of Visual Studio (2019 and below). See [Visual Studio Uninstaller](https://github.com/Microsoft/VisualStudioUninstaller/releases) for help.
    * Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition) is no longer offered publicly by Microsoft. Meanwhile, Visual Studio 2026 does not yet fully support CUDA. If you do not already have VS2022 installed locally, you can still download the executable directly by clicking [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_community.exe).
    * Alternatively, you can download VS2022 Enterprise from [Microsoft Azure for Students](https://cets.engineering.upenn.edu/answers/azure.html).
    * Once in the installer, do the following
        * Under the `Workloads` tab, select `Desktop Development with C++`. This will select almost everything you will need.
        * Under the `Individual Components Tab`, make sure these packages are selected. **DO NOT uncheck** everything else.
            * Visual Studio 2022 (in addition to above components for 2019 which are available for VS 2022):
                * MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools - Allows you to build VS 2019 projects using VS 2022
                * C++ ATL for v141 build tools (x86 & x64)
                * Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17763.0)
                * Windows 10 SDK (10.0.18362.0)
                * Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0)
                * Windows 10 SDK (10.0.22621.0)
                * Windows 10 SDK (10.0.22000.0)
                * Windows 10 SDK (10.0.20348.0)
4. Install the latest version of [**CUDA**](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (minimum version CUDA 13).
5. Install Nsight Compute, Nsight Graphics, and Nsight Systems from [https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-tools-visual-studio-integration](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-tools-visual-studio-integration).
6. Install [**CMake 4.x**](http://www.cmake.org/download/). Windows binaries are under `Binary distributions`.
7. Install [Visual C++ Redistributable 2015/17/19/22](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Note: there are 2 different install files for 2015/17/19/22 and for 2013 - you need to install 2015/17/19/22.
8. (_Optional_) Download [**GPU-Z**](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/). You can either install it, or run it as a portable executable. This provides useful information about your GPU and technologies it supports.

### Enable GPU Performance Counters

When running profiling, the Nsight tools need access to systems level counters to trace the performance. There are two options to do this:

1. Run the program as admin, which is tedious to set up each time.
2. Enable Performance counters using NVIDIA Control Panel (Recommended).

The steps to enable this are:

1. Open NVIDIA Control Panel. This can be done from the start menu, the taskbar NVIDIA icon, or Control Panel.
2. On the menu bar (top), select `Desktop -> Enable Developer Settings`.
3. On the left side panel, you will now see `Developer -> Manage GPU Performance Counter`. Change the option to `Allow access to the GPU performance counters to all users`.

See [NVIDIA Documentation](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-development-tools-solutions-err_nvgpuctrperm-permission-issue-performance-counters) for more.
